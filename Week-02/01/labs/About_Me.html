    <h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Hello! My name is Heather Marrero. I am a senior studying Information Management & Technology at Syracuse University.
Some of my favorite things to do are cooking, playing video games, drawing, and crocheting.</p>
<p>My favorite foods include:</p>
<ul>
 <li>pizza</li>
 <li>chicken pad thai</li>
 <li>beef karei raisu</li>
 <li>veggie chili</li>
</ul> 
<p>My dream job is to work at Salesforce on 42nd Street in New York City. I'd also really like to work as a UI/UX designer, a web-developer, or a consultant. </p>
<p>A fun fact about me is that I can speak 3 languages. Two fluently (English and Spanish) and one conversationally (French).</p>
