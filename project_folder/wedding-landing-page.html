        <h2> Heather's Story</h2>
        <p>I met Alida for the first time my Sophomore year at the Handball court attached to my highschool in Williamsburg, NY. We both grew up in the neighborhood,
            we had mutual friends and connections yet somehow we would always just miss each other. That day was like any other, and I really hadn't formulated any opinions on Alida other 
            than that I thought she was confident, dressed only in a sports bra and exercise spanx, and extremely cute. I joked with my bestfriend Johnathan who introduced us, asking him if he "shipped" us, or wanted us to be together.
            I was curiously entertaining the thought in my head but I didn't know how else to talk about it. Johnathan, for the most part, ignored my remarks... and I gave up on the idea for a while.
            Eventually, we began to cross paths again, and I discovered that Alida was interested in me. Without getting too into the details, I gave her the run around quite a bit
            and yet Alida was unrelenting. She wanted me to give her a chance, she knew she would make me happy. So I gave in. I let her try to court me, we weren't too serious at first
            but not long into the relationship, I think both of us realized the true depth of our feelings. We made it official and a year and six months later here we are today.
